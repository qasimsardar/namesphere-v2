# Namesphere üÜî

**Context-Aware Identity Management System**

Namesphere is a privacy-first web application that enables users to create and manage multiple identity profiles tailored for different contexts (legal, work, social, gaming). Built with modern web technologies, it implements privacy-by-design principles, ensuring that only context-appropriate information is shared when requested.

## üéØ Problem Statement

In today's digital world, we present ourselves differently across various contexts - your professional identity differs from your gaming persona, and your social media presence may be distinct from your legal documentation. Traditional identity systems force you to use a single profile everywhere, leading to:

- **Privacy concerns** - Oversharing personal information in inappropriate contexts
- **Professional boundaries** - Mixing personal and work identities
- **Context confusion** - Using the wrong name or information in different situations
- **Identity fragmentation** - Managing separate accounts across different platforms

## üöÄ Solution

Namesphere solves these problems by providing:

- **Context-Aware Profiles** - Create separate identities for work, social, legal, and gaming contexts
- **Privacy by Design** - Share only relevant information based on the context
- **Unified Management** - Control all your identities from a single, secure dashboard
- **Public Discovery** - Optional discoverability allows others to find you in appropriate contexts
- **Comprehensive Auditing** - Track all access and modifications for transparency

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîê Dual Authentication System
- **Replit OAuth** - Quick sign-in with your Replit account
- **Username/Password** - Traditional local authentication with secure password hashing

### üë§ Context-Aware Identity Management
- Create multiple identity profiles for different contexts
- Set one identity as your primary profile
- Include rich metadata: pronouns, titles, avatars, social links
- Control visibility with discoverable/private settings

### üîç Public Search System
- Search for other users within specific contexts
- Privacy-controlled discovery (users opt-in to being found)
- Context-scoped results ensure appropriate matches
- Comprehensive audit logging for all search activities

### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security
- **Owner-based access control** - Users can only access their own data
- **Context-scoped data retrieval** - See only relevant information
- **Audit logging** - Complete activity tracking for compliance
- **Session-based authentication** - Secure HTTP-only cookies
- **Field whitelisting** - Public APIs expose only safe information

### üé® Modern User Experience

## üéØ Core Contexts

The application supports four main contexts:
- **Legal** - Official names, legal documentation, formal titles
- **Work** - Professional identities, job titles, work contacts
- **Social** - Social media profiles, casual names, personal interests
- **Gaming** - Gaming handles, usernames, gaming profiles

## üîí Privacy Controls

Users have granular control over their privacy:
- **Private by default** - New identities are not discoverable
- **Context isolation** - Information only appears in relevant contexts
- **Selective disclosure** - Choose which identities to make public
- **Audit transparency** - View all access logs for your profiles
